# BVG

## Description

This project was created to find shortest path between two given stations in Berlin's U-Bahn. We used BVG's website to collect all the U-Bahn's stations and lines, and listed them in StopNames (1).txt. We then added the stations, lines, and station coordinates to a datastructure in order to perform the search algorithm. We used both greedy and breadth-first to achieve our goal.
